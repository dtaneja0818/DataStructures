4. Are you good with multi-tasking OR Give an example how you tackled with multiple responsibilities?

During my past job, I have to handle multiple responsibilities in developing new projects, maintaining existing ones, and maintaining good client relations. 
I allocate a certain amount of time for each area daily. 
That way clients can see very clearly that projects are progressing, and I have more satisfaction in accomplishing multiple tasks under pressure.
 
I always work on S-A-R (situation-action-result) technique.
I took a time-management course in which I learned to prioritize all tasks on A, B, or C lists. I always try to tackle the A list first. 
In every working situation, co-workers have always complimented me on how well I manage my time. 
I enjoy the social atmosphere of the office, but I make it a point not to waste much time on chitchat with colleagues. 
I've also learned that the average office worker spends about an hour a day handling e-mail. 
I make it a point not to deal with my e-mail more than once or twice a day, and I filter my messages into folders so I can prioritize the way I deal with them.

5. Did you ever work with teams for your projects? How did you handle conflicts within a team?
Yes I usually work in teams for my projects as I feel that Teamwork can provide collective strength and staying power for the business or organization.

I am a proactive So, I usually monitor situations closely to prevent minor problems from escalating into major ones. 
In most cases, minor problems can be resolved by simply meeting individually with affected team members. 
It's not a good idea to ignore a problem in hopes that it will resolve itself.

At a previous job, I was responsible for resolving a conflict between two team members who could no longer work effectively together. 
Their relationship began affecting the productivity of other employees. The first thing I did was separate them to calm the situation. 
I then proceeded to meet together with both parties to discuss the problem in a calm and controlled setting. 
I assumed control of the discussion since emotions frequently trump reason during disputes between two people and made it clear that a compromise must be reached. 
One of my main objectives during the meeting was to understand the perspectives of both parties without siding with either one. 
At first, this was difficult since each party presented their arguments without considering other perspectives. 
To counter this, I made it clear to each party that changes must be made since the status quo was unworkable. Shortly thereafter, we agreed to a workable solution. 
Before concluding the meeting, I emphasized that during future disagreements each party must act considerably and professionally and avoid getting emotional. 
After our meeting, work resumed as normal and the overall work atmosphere became more pleasant.

	6. Tell me about your prior experience fits for this position OR What about your experiences makes you fit for this position?
My education and life experience have prepared me to take on the challenges of this position.
My previous work experience and academic projects which involved extensive coding and working on UI Technologies, have provided me with the ideal experience for this position and 
my skill set is a perfect match for the job requirements.
