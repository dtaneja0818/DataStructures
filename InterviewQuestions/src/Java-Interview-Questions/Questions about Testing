How dou you do testing?

Ans Talk about Unit testing

In Java we have JUnit for unit testing (using assert to check the code).
Learn more about Unit testing from the following code of Wikipedia.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing


In testing we touch upon the following:
Black box(checks the behaviour of the code) and White box testing(checks the actual code)

Check whether the application written is:
1) Compatible with all enviornments on which it is going to run
2) If its a web application it should be able to run on multiple browsers(Using JQuery we can achieve this)
3) Check which resources it will require to function properly(for example: Main memory, hard disk space and 
CPU specifications)
4) If its a web application, check its behaviour in flickering internet connection(throw appropriate 
messages to the User that the internet connection is unstable so that the user is aware of the exact problem)
