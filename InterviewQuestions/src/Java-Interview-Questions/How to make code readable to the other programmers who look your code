The following methods can be used to make sure that the code is readable and understood by everyone who will
follow you:
1) Put COMMENTS on important functions on how they behave
2) Strong DOCUMENTATION for every function implemented properly
3) Using MEANINGFUL NAMES for variables and object names so that they can be understood properly
Example: Animal i =new Animal(); // instead of using i variable we can use
         Animal animalInstance = new Animal();
4) Using the SAME STYLE of writing the code as used by the entire team, so that other members can understand
your code that is written.
