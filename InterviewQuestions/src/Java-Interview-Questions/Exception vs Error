Question:  What is the difference between exception and error?
Ans: An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime like out of
memory error. These kind of jvm errors cannot be handled at runtime.
Exceptions are because of condition failures, which can be handled
easily at runtime.


The super class of both Exception(which is a class) and Error(which is a class) is Throwable(which is a class).
