HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap
http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2010/10/what-is-difference-between-synchronized.html

1.  Thread -Safe : ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe that is the code can be accessed by single thread at a time while HashMap is not thread-safe.
2.  Synchronization Method : HashMap can be synchronized by using synchronizedMap(HashMap)  method. By using this method we get a HashMap object which 
is equivalent to the HashTable object . 
	So every modification  is performed on  Map is locked on Map object.


import java.util.*;

public class HashMapSynchronization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create map
        Map<String,String> map = new HashMap<String,String>();
        
        // populate the map
        map.put("1","ALIVE ");
        map.put("2","IS");
        map.put("3","AWESOME");
        
        // create a synchronized map
        Map<String,String> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(map);
        
        System.out.println("Synchronized map :"+syncMap);
    }
}

ConcurrentHashMap synchronizes or locks on the certain portion of the Map. To optimize the performance of ConcurrentHashMap, Map is divided into different 
partitions depending upon the Concurrency level. So that we do not need to synchronize the whole Map Object.


3.  Null Key: ConcurrentHashMap does not allow NULL values . So the key can not be null in ConcurrentHashMap. While In HashMap there can only be one null key.
  
4.  Performance 

     In multiple threaded environment HashMap is usually faster than ConcurrentHashMap . As only single thread can access the certain portion of the 
     Map and thus reducing the performance . 
     While in HashMap any number of threads can access the code at the same time .


So what is the difference between hashtable and ConcurrentHashMap , both can be used in multithreaded environment but once the size of hashtable becomes 
considerable large performance degrade because for iteration it has to be locked for longer duration.

Since ConcurrentHashMap indroduced concept of segmentation , how large it becomes only certain part of it get locked to provide thread safety so many other 
readers can still access map without waiting for iteration to complete.

In Summary ConcurrentHashMap only locked certain portion of Map while Hashtable lock full map while doing iteration.
