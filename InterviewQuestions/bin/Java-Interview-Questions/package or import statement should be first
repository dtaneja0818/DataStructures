Here's an example:
If there is a package statement, that is the first line of your source code.



package example;  
   
class ExampleClass{  
   
// class body goes here....  
   
}  


If there is an import statement, then it should follow your package statement and all the imports should start before a class definition.


package example;  
   
import java.util.Date;  
import java.util.Collections;  
   
class ExampleClass{  
   
// class body goes here....  
   
}  

If there is an import statement and no package statement, then the import statement would be your first statement of the source code.



import java.util.Date;  
   
class ExampleClass{  
   
// class body goes here....  
   
}  

If there is no package statement and there are no import statements, then obviously the class declaration would be the first line of your source code.


class ExampleClass{  
   
// class body goes here....  
   
}  


Hope this makes it clear!
