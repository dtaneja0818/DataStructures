Question: Can non-static methods (Local classes) have static members?
Ans: No, non-static member classes cannot have static members. Because,
an instance of a non-static member class or local class must be
created in the context of an instance of the enclosing class. You
can declare constants, means static final variables.

Example:
class Demo {
public void hello(){
 static int n=10;
 System.out.println(n);
 
}
}
class AbstractDemo{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Demo d=new Demo();
    d.hello();
	}
}

Output: Compilation Error: Non static method hello() cannot have static member n=10
