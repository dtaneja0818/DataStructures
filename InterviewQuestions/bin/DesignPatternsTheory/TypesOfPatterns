Types of Design Pattern
As per the design pattern reference book Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software , there are 33 design patterns. 
These patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and behavioral patterns. We'll also discuss another category of design 
patterns: J2EE design patterns.


	1	Creational Patterns
These design patterns provides way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. 
This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
	2	Structural Patterns
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to 
obtain new functionalities.
	3	Behavioral Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
	4	J2EE Patterns
These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
