In particular, a B-tree:
keeps keys in sorted order for sequential traversing
uses a hierarchical index to minimize the number of disk reads
uses partially full blocks to speed insertions and deletions
keeps the index balanced with an elegant recursive algorithm
In addition, a B-tree minimizes waste by making sure the interior nodes are at least half full. A B-tree can handle an arbitrary number of insertions 
and deletions.
